The cycle time reports include:

1. Cycle time scatterplot. This shows the cycle times of issues completed in a given period against their completion date, as well as percentiles to indicate typical and worst cases.

2. Cycle time histogram. This visualises the cycle time distribution of issues completed in the specified time period with a Pareto chart.

3. Ageing WIP (work in progress) chart. This shows the current age of in progress issues relative to other issues completed in the specified time period.
